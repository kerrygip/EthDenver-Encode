Homework 1
Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server.

Consider
What are the essential pieces of functionality ?
Ledger/NFT - Deed to property that you own it 
Peer to Peer Transactions (rent/P2P/selling properties/buying properties) 
Decentralized Bank - but no bank because it's P2P (create tokens to transact) - tokens to be initilized for transactions
Smart Contract - to buy property if no one owns 
Random number(dice)

- Physical ledger when buying properties - cards
- Monopoly EVM 
    - Create Tokens to be utilized as money - Monopoly ETH
    - GRN - To advance in the game
    - Buying properties from the EVM
- P2P transactions -
    - Loans 
    - Mortgages 
    - Paying rents 
    - Sell properties



How would people cheat ?
Trust is a lot easier to break when thereâ€™s less people
Physically intimidating or assaulting them and stealing ledgers 
double spending because there's no verification on the ledger 
flip the board, kill the game


How could you prevent them from cheating ?
Honor code/ personal integrity 
Have enough people around to maintain integrity 

This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any detailed
design.
